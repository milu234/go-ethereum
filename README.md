Quorum is an Ethereum-based distributed ledger protocol with transaction/contract privacy and new consensus mechanisms.

Quorum is a fork of [go-ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum) and is updated in line with go-ethereum releases.

Key enhancements over go-ethereum:

  * __Privacy__ - Quorum supports private transactions and private contracts through public/private state separation and utilising [Constellation](https://github.com/jpmorganchase/constellation), a peer-to-peer encrypted message exchange for directed transfer of private data to network participants
  * __Alternative Consensus Mechanisms__ - with no need for POW/POS in a permissioned network, Quorum instead offers multiple consensus mechanisms that are more appropriate for consortium chains:
    * __Raft-based Consensus__ - a consensus model for faster blocktimes, transaction finality, and on-demand block creation
    * __Istanbul BFT__ - a PBFT-inspired consensus algorithm with transaction finality, by AMIS.
  * __Peer Permissioning__ - node/peer permissioning using smart contracts, ensuring only known parties can join the network
  * __Higher Performance__ - Quorum offers significantly higher performance than public geth

Note: The QuorumChain consensus algorithm is not yet supported by this release.

## Architecture

<a href="https://github.com/jpmorganchase/quorum/wiki/Transaction-Processing#private-transaction-process-flow">![Quorum privacy architecture](https://github.com/jpmorganchase/quorum-docs/raw/master/images/QuorumTransactionProcessing.JPG)</a>

The above diagram is a high-level overview of the privacy architecture used by Quorum. For more in-depth discussion of the components, refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/jpmorganchase/quorum/wiki/) pages.

## Quickstart

The quickest way to get started with Quorum is using [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) and [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html):

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jpmorganchase/quorum-examples
cd quorum-examples
vagrant up
# (should take 5 or so minutes)
vagrant ssh
```

Now that you have a fully-functioning Quorum environment set up, let's run the 7-node cluster example. This will spin up several nodes with a mix of voters, block makers, and unprivileged nodes.

```sh
# (from within vagrant env, use `vagrant ssh` to enter)
ubuntu@ubuntu-xenial:~$ cd quorum-examples/7nodes

$ ./raft-init.sh
# (output condensed for clarity)
[*] Cleaning up temporary data directories
[*] Configuring node 1
[*] Configuring node 2 as block maker and voter
[*] Configuring node 3
[*] Configuring node 4 as voter
[*] Configuring node 5 as voter
[*] Configuring node 6
[*] Configuring node 7

$ ./raft-start.sh
[*] Starting Constellation nodes
[*] Starting bootnode... waiting... done
[*] Starting node 1
[*] Starting node 2
[*] Starting node 3
[*] Starting node 4
[*] Starting node 5
[*] Starting node 6
[*] Starting node 7
[*] Unlocking account and sending first transaction
Contract transaction send: TransactionHash: 0xbfb7bfb97ba9bacbf768e67ac8ef05e4ac6960fc1eeb6ab38247db91448b8ec6 waiting to be mined...
true
```

We now have a 7-node Quorum cluster with a [private smart contract](https://github.com/jpmorganchase/quorum-examples/blob/master/examples/7nodes/script1.js) (SimpleStorage) sent from `node 1` "for" `node 7` (denoted by the public key passed via `privateFor: ["ROAZBWtSacxXQrOe3FGAqJDyJjFePR5ce4TSIzmJ0Bc="]` in the `sendTransaction` call).

Connect to any of the nodes and inspect them using the following commands:

```sh
$ geth attach ipc:qdata/dd1/geth.ipc
$ geth attach ipc:qdata/dd2/geth.ipc
...
$ geth attach ipc:qdata/dd7/geth.ipc


# e.g.

$ geth attach ipc:qdata/dd2/geth.ipc
Welcome to the Geth JavaScript console!

  to: null,
  transactionIndex: 1,
  v: "0x25",
  value: 0
}
```

Note in particular the `v` field of "0x25" (37 in decimal) which marks this transaction as having a private payload (input).
